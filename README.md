# Volatility-Forecasting

The objective of this study is to investigate and implement two distinct approaches for forecasting
volatility. The first approach involves utilizing GARCH-type models from the traditional literature
of financial econometrics, while the second approach employs Machine Learning models, specifically
Neural Networks. The data utilized for this study was obtained from Yahoo Finance, and includes a
10-year daily dataset of the NASDAQ 100 (NDX).
The results of this study suggest that Neural Networks are able to achieve superior performance
when compared to Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models. However, it
should be noted that this improved performance is accompanied by a reduction in interpretability and
explainability of the predicted values.

The code for the implementation of Neural Networks comes from https://github.com/chibui191/bitcoin_volatility_forecasting.
